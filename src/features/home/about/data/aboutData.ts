  description: `I'm a passionate Junior Frontend Developer based in Indonesia, specializing in creating beautiful and interactive web experiences. My journey started in my 4th semester when I discovered the magic of building user interfaces.

I love turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.`,
